# SHA-100

SHA-100 is my secure hashing algorithm (SHA for short, and 100 refers to the number of bites returned). I got inspired to build this function from the infamous SHA-256, altho mine is so much simpler and accepts only text. It's built using Typescript, the amazing Javascript superset that I recently started using. The user interface is created using EJS and styled with Materialize. And the rest of the back-end with Nodejs(Express).
